Overview
--------

fake is a simple utility designed to enable the switching in of
backup servers buy bringing up an additional interface
and using arp spoofing to take over the ip address. Either
additional physically or logical interfaces can be used.

Variants of the script have been used extensively at Zip World,
http://www.zipworld.com.au./ for backing up various servers
including the mail, web and proxy servers. Please be aware that
though this system has been shown to work you are well advised to
test the system throughly before putting into production.

Please see the docs directory for a more thorough discussion
of the process that has been implemented and the issues surrounding
its use.
